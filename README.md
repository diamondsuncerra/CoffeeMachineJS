# CoffeeMachineJS
  This is a JavaScript project that implements a Coffee Machine as a prompt dialogue.
The Coffee Machine takes one of the following arguments: exit, remaining, fill, buy, take.

exit -> shuts down the Coffee Machine
remaining -> displays the amount of sugar, coffee beans, milk, water and money it has
fill -> promts the user if he wants to add certain amounts of sugar, coffee, water or milk
buy -> asks the user if he wants a coffee (1 - espresso 2 - latte 3 - cappuccino)
take -> if the user wants to take the money from the machine. This is only available 
if the user has the password ("FIRSTJS2023")

  This project uses the readline-sync Node.js module to read the input.
